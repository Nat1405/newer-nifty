Data Reduction Examples
=======================

Observations of Titan
---------------------

Recipe used: defaultConfig.cfg

Observations of a Moderate Redshift Galaxy
------------------------------------------

Recipe used: defaultConfig.cfg

Let's reduce NIFS data of a moderate redshift galaxy, located at z ~ 1.284. This is a faint target, so after making
individual cubes we use the reported telescope P and Q offsets to blindly merge our final cubes.

As this program is out of its proprietary period and available on the Gemini Public Archive, we can use the defaultConfig.cfg configuration
file and specify its program ID to reduce it.

.. code-block:: text

   runNifty -f GN-2013A-Q-62

We could also launch the reduction from a provided configuration file.


Contents of the configuration file:

.. code-block:: text

   TODO(nat): When finalized fill this out!

To launch the reduction:

.. code-block:: text

   runNifty <configurationFile>
