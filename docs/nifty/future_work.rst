Future Work
===========

Throughout the code, I've placed MANY TODO(nat) notes. These are my top priorities for now.

Some nice to haves:

-
- Add Python 3 compatability(if possible)
- Ability to restart individual steps easily
- Add some sort of status indicators... Like progress
- Paralellisation?
- Analysis tools: automatic velocity field? Dispersion?
